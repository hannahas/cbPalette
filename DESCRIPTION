Description: Provides a colorblind-friendly palette to use with 'ggplot2'. This works 
    for discrete color maps only. The package provides up to seven colors to be used
    in a plot. More than seven colors are difficult to discern for colorblind users.
    This works for both scale_color_manual() and scale_fill_manual().
